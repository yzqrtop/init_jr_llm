Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine how physical and social environments, as measured by household chaos, affect the diabetes control (ie, A1C) in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Methods: One hundred and four patients (53 male, 51 female) with T1DM (aged 1-13 years) and their caregivers were recruited from a diabetes clinic at a Midwestern children's hospital. The caregivers completed a demographic questionnaire as well as a questionnaire pertaining to chaos in the household. A medical record review at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-up was also conducted. Results: Results found that above and beyond the demographic covariates, there still remained a significant relationship between household chaos and glycemic control. Those who scored more than 1 standard deviation above the mean Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) measure score showed significantly worse glycemic control at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the relationship of family environment and glycemic control for youth with T1DM. The findings highlight the need to individually assess the youth's home environment to promote diabetes management and care during clinic visits.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether activin A, inhibin A, and inhibin B levels in maternal and umbilical artery serum change according to the mode of delivery. DESIGN: Maternal and cord blood specimens were collected at term after spontaneous labour and vaginal delivery, or elective caesarean section. SETTING: Universities of Pisa, Turin, Naples and Udine. POPULATION: Forty-two healthy pregnant women, at 3940 weeks of gestation, divided into two subgroups: group 1 vaginal delivery (n = 21), were delivered of 10 female and 11 male infants; group 2 elective caesarean section (n = 21), were delivered of 11 female and 10 male infants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum activin A, inhibin A, inhibin B concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood. RESULTS: At vaginal delivery, maternal serum inhibin A and inhibin B levels were lower and activin A levels higher than at elective caesarean section. Maternal levels of activin A, inhibin A and inhibin B were constantly higher than in umbilical arterial blood, independent of the mode of delivery. No significant difference was observed in umbilical arterial serum levels of the three proteins between the two modes of delivery. Umbilical arterial serum activin A and inhibin A concentrations did not show a significant difference between male and female infants in either vaginal or caesarean section, but male infants showed inhibin B levels significantly higher than female, independent of the mode of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of active labour, the human placenta secretes larger amounts of activin A and lesser amounts of inhibin A and inhibin B into the maternal circulation. Inhibin-related proteins in the fetal circulation do not show differences according to the mode of delivery, suggesting that they have a different method of production or metabolic rate compared with maternal activin and inhibins.
Purposes: Women with diabetes (WD) are more severely impacted by the consequence of suboptimal diabetes control. This study aims to examine the impact of demographic and disease characteristics, baseline self-stigma, role strain, diabetes distress on Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) levels, quality of life (D-QoL) and 6-month A1C levels in younger WD. Methods: This study was a 6-month prospective study. In total, 193 WD aged 20-64 years were selected by convenience sampling from three outpatient clinics in Taiwan. Demographic and disease characteristics, self-stigma, role strain, diabetes distress, A1C levels, and D-QoL were collected at baseline. A1C levels were further collected 6 months later. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the hypothesized model. Results: The final model supported that higher baseline D-QoL directly associated with lower concurrent A1C levels and indirectly associated with lower 6-month A1C levels through baseline A1C levels. Higher baseline self-stigma, role strain, and diabetes distress directly associated with lower baseline D-QoL, and indirectly associated with higher 6-month A1C levels through D-QoL. Conclusion: Improving self-stigma, role strain, and diabetes distress should be considered as promising strategies to improve D-QoL in young WD. D-QoL plays a mediation role between baseline self-stigma, role strain, diabetes distress and subsequent glycemic control in younger WD. Enhancing baseline D-QoL is fundamental to improve subsequent glycemic control.
OBJECTIVE: Hispanics have higher rates of diabetes and diabetes-related complications than do non-Hispanic whites. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the difference between the mean values of A1C for these two groups. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We executed a PubMed search of articles published from 1993 through July 2007. Data sources included PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Cochrane Library, Combined Health Information Database, and Education Resources Information Center. Data on sample size, age, sex, A1C, geographical location, and study design were extracted. Cross-sectional data and baseline data from clinical trials and cohort studies for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites with diabetes were included. Studies were excluded if they included individuals <18 years of age or patients with pre-diabetes or gestational diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 495 studies were reviewed, of which 73 contained data on A1C for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, and 11met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant mean difference (P < 0.0001) of -0.46 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.33), correlating to an approximately 0.5% higher A1C for Hispanics. Grouping studies by design (cross-sectional or cohort), method of data collection for A1C (chart review or blood sampling), and care type (managed or nonmanaged) yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, A1C was approximately 0.5% higher in Hispanic patients with diabetes than in non-Hispanic patients. Understanding the reasons for this disparity should be a focus for future research.
OBJECTIVE: To determine, in an adult population with type 1 diabetes, barriers to regular physical activity using a diabetes-specific barriers measure (the Barriers to Physical Activity in Diabetes [type 1] [BAPAD1] scale) and factors associated with these barriers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred adults with type 1 diabetes answered a questionnaire assessing perceived barriers to physical activity and related factors. A1C was obtained from the medical chart of each individual. RESULTS: Fear of hypoglycemia was identified as being the strongest barrier to physical activity. Greater knowledge about insulin pharmacokinetics and using appropriate approaches to minimize exercise-induced hypoglycemia were factors associated with fewer perceived barriers. Greater barriers were positively correlated with A1C levels (r = 0.203; P = 0.042) and negatively with well-being (r = -0.45; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Fear of hypoglycemia is the strongest barrier to regular physical activity in adults with type 1 diabetes, who should therefore be informed and supported in hypoglycemia management.

Grove and Halpern, and more recently Douven and Romeijn, have argued that one ought to leave credence in A unchanged, i.e. fixed at P(A). We argue that while the former approach is superior, it brings about a reflection violation due in part to neglect of a “regression to the mean” phenomenon, whereby when C is eliminated by random evidence that leaves A and B alive, the ratio P(A)?:?P(B) ought to drift in the direction of 1?:?1.
Context Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) do not meet glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets. Objective This work aimed to assess HbA(1c) outcomes in children with new-onset T1D enrolled in the Teamwork, Targets, Technology and Tight Control (4T) Study. Methods HbA(1c) levels were compared between the 4T and historical cohorts. HbA(1c) differences between cohorts were estimated using locally estimated scatter plot smoothing (LOESS). The change from nadir HbA(1c) (month 4) to 12 months post diagnosis was estimated by cohort using a piecewise mixed-effects regression model accounting for age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and insurance type. We recruited 135 youth with newly diagnosed T1D at Stanford Children's Health. Starting July 2018, all youth within the first month of T1D diagnosis were offered continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) initiation and remote CGM data review was added in March 2019. The main outcomes measure was HbA(1c). Results HbA(1c) at 6, 9, and 12 months post diagnosis was lower in the 4T cohort than in the historic cohort (-0.54% to -0.52%, and -0.58%, respectively). Within the 4T cohort, HbA(1c) at 6, 9, and 12 months post diagnosis was lower in those patients with remote monitoring than those without (-0.14%, -0.18% to -0.14%, respectively). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the 4T cohort experienced a significantly lower increase in HbA(1c) between months 4 and 12 (P < .001). Conclusion A technology-enabled, team-based approach to intensified new-onset education involving target setting, CGM initiation, and remote data review statistically significantly decreased HbA(1c) in youth with T1D 12 months post diagnosis.
The objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the association of ACE I/D, -240A>T and AT1R 1166A>C polymorphisms with breast cancer (BC) risk. A comprehensive search on databases was conducted to identify all eligible case-control studies. Finally, 35 case-control studies, including 20 studies for ACE I/D, seven studies for ACE 240A>T, and eight studies for AT1R 1166A > C were included. The pooled analysis showed a significant association between ACE I/D polymorphism and BC risk under three genetic models, i.e., heterozygote (ID vs. DD: OR = 0.707, 95% CI 0.528-0.946, p = 0.020), homo-zygote (II vs. DD: OR = 0.662, 95% CI 0.462-0.947, p = 0.024), and dominant (II + ID vs. DD: OR = 0.691, 95% CI 0.507-0.941, p = 0.019). A significant association was also observed in ACE I/D polymorphism with BC risk among Asians and Caucasians. However, ACE -240A > T and AT1R 1166A > C polymorphisms were not associated with BC. Stratified analyses by ethnicity showed a significant association of ACE -240A>T and AT1R 1166A>C polymorphisms with BC risk in Latinos populations, but not in Asians. This meta-analysis inconsistence with all previous meta-analyses suggests that the ACE I/D might be associated with BC in overall and by ethnicity. However, the ACE -240A > T and AT1R 1166 A > C were associated with BC risk only among Latinos populations.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between dose of N-0861 ([+/-]N6-endo-norbornan-2-yl-9-methyladenine), N-0861 plasma concentrations, and antagonism of adenosine-induced slowing of atrioventricular nodal conduction and to evaluate A1-receptor occupancy by antagonist present in plasma of subjects after administration of N-0861 to determine A1-selectivity of these effects. METHODS: The study was conducted in patients undergoing a clinically indicated electrophysiology study to evaluate atrioventricular nodal conduction. Nineteen subjects were enrolled in the study and received adenosine (60 to 140 microg/kg) before or during a bolus dose and maintenance infusion of specific doses of N-0861. Adenosine-induced slowing of atrioventricular nodal conduction was determined by measuring A-H intervals on the intracardiac electrocardiograms. Plasma concentrations of N-0861 were determined with an HPLC method. A1-Receptor occupancy by antagonist present in plasma from identical time points was determined with use of a radioreceptor assay. RESULTS: A linear relationship was shown between plasma concentration and dose of N-0861. A-H interval lengthening by 60 microg/kg adenosine was reduced by administration of N-0861. A linear relationship was observed between A1 occupancy and N-0861 concentration and between occupancy and antagonism of adenosine-induced A-H prolongation. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the effect of N-0861 on antagonism of adenosine-induced prolongation of A-H interval, at the doses used in this study, were the result of effects at the A1 receptor.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of alpha (s1)-casein hydrolysate on females with stress-related symptoms. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: The alpha (s1)-casein hydrolysate was manufactured by INGREDIA (Arras, France) and the placebo was manufactured by DIETAROMA (Bourg, France). Study was designed and performed at PROCLAIM (Rennes, France), and the statistical analyses were performed by D Desor (Nancy, France). SUBJECTS: A total of 63 female volunteers suffering from at least one disorder that may be related to stress such as anxiety, sleep problems and general fatigue. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 63 volunteers participated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either tablets containing alpha (s1)-casein hydrolysate or placebo at the dose of 150 mg/day for 30 days. After a 3 weeks washout period, they were crossed over for a new 30-day period of tablets intake. The outcome measure was a questionnaire including 44 items of symptoms that may be related stress in which the severity of each sign was evaluated using a 10-degree scale. These measures were studied repeatedly at the day of 0, 15 and 30 after the start of each interventional period. RESULTS: The 30-day treatment by alpha (s1)-casein hydrolysate in females with stress-related symptoms reduced their symptoms, particularly in digestion (P<0.01), cardiovascular (P<0.05), intellectual (P<0.01), emotional (P<0.05) and social problems (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed that a 30-day ingestion of alpha (s1)-casein hydrolysate decreased the stress-related symptoms in females suggesting that this product may be used as an effective functional ingredient alleviating such symptoms. Sponsorship: This study was partially supported by the INGREDIA of France and Neurobiology Research Program from the Korea Ministry of Science and Technology (2004-01757) of Korea.
